    "* Zero-shot classification\n",
    "* Few-shot learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how existing, open-source (and proprietary) models can be used out-of-the-box for many applications.  For this, we will use [Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/models) and some simple prompt engineering.\n",

    "1. Use a variety of existing models for a variety of common applications.\n",
    "1. Understand basic prompt engineering.\n",
    "1. Understand search vs. sampling for LLM inference.\n",
    "1. Get familiar with the main Hugging Face abstractions: datasets, pipelines, tokenizers, and models."

For more details, see the [Google blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html), [code on GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer), or the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).  For our purposes, it supports translation for English, French, Romanian, and German."

    "Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.\n",
    "It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\n",

    "The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\n",
    "However, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.\n",

    "\n",
    "You may see parameters like `num_beams`, `do_sample`, etc. specified in Hugging Face pipelines.  These are inference configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs work by predicting (generating) the next token, then the next, and so on.  The goal is to generate a high probability sequence of tokens, which is essentially a search through the (enormous) space of potential sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this search, LLMs use one of two main methods:\n",
    "* **Search**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next most likely token in a \"search.\"\n",
    "   * **Greedy search** (default): Pick the single next most likely token in a greedy search (top-1).\n",
    "   * **Beam search**: Greedy search can be extended via beam search, which searches down several sequence paths, via the parameter `num_beams`.\n",
    "* **Sampling**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next token by sampling from the predicted distribution of tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-K sampling**: The parameter `top_k` modifies sampling by limiting it to the `k` most likely tokens.\n",
    "   * **Top-p (nucleus) sampling**: The parameter `top_p` modifies sampling by limiting it to the most likely tokens up to probability mass `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "** NOTE: Some of sampling method: random sampling, temperature sampling, ...\n",
    "\n",
